Here’s a set of themes for practicing the Java 21 Streams API, organized from easy to complex:

### **Easy: Basic Stream Operations**

1. **Filtering and Mapping**:
    - **Task**: Given a list of integers, filter even numbers and square them.
2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**:
    - **Task**: From a list of floating-point numbers, find the minimum and maximum values.
3. **Sorting and Collecting to List**:
    - **Task**: Given a list of strings, sort them alphabetically and collect them back to a list.
4. **Converting to Uppercase**:
    - **Task**: Take a list of lowercase strings and convert them to uppercase.
5. **Counting Elements**:
    - **Task**: Count how many strings in a list start with a specific character.

### **Intermediate: Aggregations and Grouping**

6. **Grouping by Age**:
    - **Task**: Given a list of `Person` objects, group them by age.
7. **Partitioning by Predicate**:
    - **Task**: Partition a list of integers into even and odd numbers.
8. **Summing and Averaging**:
    - **Task**: Calculate the average salary of employees in a list.
9. **FlatMap Example**:
    - **Task**: Given a list of sentences, split each sentence into words and collect them into a list.
10. **Finding Duplicates**:
    - **Task**: From a list of integers, find and return all duplicates.

### **Advanced: Complex Stream Operations**

11. **Parallel Streams for Large Data**:
    - **Task**: Use parallel streams to find the sum of a large array of integers.
12. **Custom Collectors**:
    - **Task**: Implement a custom collector to concatenate strings with a delimiter.
13. **Multi-Level Grouping**:
    - **Task**: From a list of transactions, group them by city and then by transaction type.
14. **Reducing Operations**:
    - **Task**: Find the longest string in a list using the `reduce()` method.
15. **Stream of Streams**:
    - **Task**: From a list of lists of integers, create a single flattened list of integers.

### **Expert: Real-World Scenarios**

16. **Finding Median in a Stream**:
    - **Task**: Given a stream of integers, find the median value efficiently.
17. **Implementing Pagination with Streams**:
    - **Task**: Implement a method that paginates a list of objects using streams.
18. **Processing Nested Maps**:
    - **Task**: Given a nested map structure, extract all unique keys and values.
19. **Building a Histogram**:
    - **Task**: Count the frequency of each character in a given string.
20. **Data Pipeline Simulation**:
    - **Task**: Create a data pipeline that performs data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation on a list of
      objects.

Practicing these themes will improve your comfort and speed with the Streams API, which will be helpful for interviews.
